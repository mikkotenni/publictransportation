# Background

## My online references

I'm regularly reading [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) and [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/).

## Latest articles/videos that I still remember (for whatever reason that may be)

[A Complete Guide to Custom Properties](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-custom-properties/) is a nice round-up
of CSS custom properties.\
[What are Design Tokens? with Jina Anne](https://podcast.smashingmagazine.com/episodes/what-are-design-tokens-with-jina-anne) was nice
to listen to. It's about design tokens and how they relate to design systems.\
[Vue JS 2 Tutorial #38 - Mixins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZuml1Y9BmQ) a video about distributing reusable features in terms
of Vue components.

## Public resources I have contributed to
[Vuetify Datepicker Proto](https://codepen.io/mikkotenni/pen/bGWYNJv) this is an example of how I tend to prototype things and then
share it so it can be useful for others.\
[GitHub/mikkotenni](https://github.com/mikkotenni) is also obviously one.

# Notes

Lines are sorted by id in ascending order. But in a way that subway lines come first. It's difficult to say would it make sense to sort them by
colors as the meaning of it is unclear. Also, as user is able to filter lines, listing is just a starting point.

# Getting Started with this application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Please clone repository to preferred location, browse to that folder and run `npm install`. Then
you are ready to run application in development mode.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
